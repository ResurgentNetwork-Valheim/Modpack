3. Inside the modpack there is a quick link where all you need to do is basically click a button and you will connect.

### Nexus Mods

This is a list of mods manually added to this modpack due to them not being available by the mod author directly on Thunderstore. Each mod is listed with the Nexus link & version number

| Mod Name                                                                                 | Version Used |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| [Badgers Valheim Skies](https://www.nexusmods.com/valheim/mods/1594)                     | 0.9.0        |
| [HD Skies for Valheim - HD Aurora Borealis](https://www.nexusmods.com/valheim/mods/1593) | 1.1          |
| [Floating Items](https://www.nexusmods.com/valheim/mods/241)                             | 1.0.0        |
| [Smarter Containers](https://www.nexusmods.com/valheim/mods/332)                         | 1.6.0        |

### Optional Mods

The mods listed below are Optional but recommended to install. These mods _cannot_ be added to a modpack as they directly replace game resources/files although they are used for in game screenshots for displaying on the [Resurgent Network](https://resurgent.network) gaming community website and in other user photo galleries.

##### [HD Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/valheim/mods/1620)

Drastically improves graphics quality. Has two separate packages based on your graphics hardware. Read the mod description **fully** to ensure you download and use the correct one for your graphics hardware.

### Notes

_To Nexus mod authors: If you release your mod to Thunderstore I will **gladly** remove your manually added mod and add it correctly as a [dependency](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/create/docs/) to this modpack. The people running the server that **this** modpack needs uses Linux native, [r2modman](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/ebkr/r2modman/) is the only mod manager able to be ran native on Linux. Considering that Valheim is a cross platform game, and the main developer at Iron Gate develops native on Linux please consider releasing your mods onto Thunderstore._
