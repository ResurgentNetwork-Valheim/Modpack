### Optional Mods

The mods listed below are Optional but recommended to install. These mods _cannot_ be added to a modpack as they directly replace game resources/files although they are used for in game screenshots for displaying on the [Resurgent Network](https://resurgent.network) gaming community website and in other user photo galleries.

##### [HD Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/valheim/mods/1620)

Drastically improves graphics quality. Has two separate packages based on your graphics hardware. Read the mod description **fully** to ensure you download and use the correct one for your graphics hardware.

### Notes

_To Nexus mod authors: If you release your mod to Thunderstore I will **gladly** remove your manually added mod and add it correctly as a [dependency](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/create/docs/) to this modpack. The people running the server that **this** modpack needs uses Linux native, [r2modman](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/ebkr/r2modman/) is the only mod manager able to be ran native on Linux. Considering that Valheim is a cross platform game, and the main developer at Iron Gate develops native on Linux please consider releasing your mods onto Thunderstore._
